@Controller -> Classes annotated with this, are intended to receive a request from the client side. The first request comes to the Dispatcher Servlet,
 from where it passes the request to the particular controller using the value of @RequestMapping annotation.
@Service -> Classes annotated with this, are intended to manipulate data, that we receive from the client or fetch from the database. All the manipulation 
with data should be done in this layer.
@Repository -> Classes annotated with this, are intended to connect with database. It can also be considered as DAO(Data Access Object) layer.
 This layer should be restricted to CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) operations only. If any manipulation is required, data should be sent be
 send back to @Service layer.
